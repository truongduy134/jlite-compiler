jlite-compiler
==============

A group project for course CS4212: Compiler Design at National University of Singapore. Build a compiler for JLITE language which is strongly-typed and is a subset of Java

Compilation
=============
In terminal, run:

    make
    
A directory `bin` is created containing all intermediate files. An executable file `jlite_main` is in `bin` directory. A copy of `jlite_main` is also put in your current directory.

To clean the project (removing files generated in compilation, including `jlite_main`), in terminal, run:

    make clean
